# GHOULS_FIXER_v3
Repository for continuum normalizing, and radial velocity correcting GHOST spectra.

Adapted from code designed by Triana Cortejo.

Note: Need to update README + Right now some of the subfolders are technically from git repositories - should I remove the git repository link, and store all of the data? Or find the links to the git repos..?
